WELCOME!
Welcome to my game! This game is known as Cheeser. This is a play on Frogger, so if you have played Frogger, you should have a good idea of the rules. If you have never played Frogger, this README file will have the information you know to play and succeed.

Movement:
To move the player character, you may either use the up, down, left, and right arrows, or the w, a, s, and d keys. 

Game Rules:
The rules of this game are simple. You spawn in and you have to reach the yellow squares towards the top of the screen. However, this may not be as simple as it sounds. In order to reach the yellow squares or Cheeses if you will, you must dodge constantly moving enemies in the first 5 lanes ahead of you. After you've passed them, you have to ride on dishes across a sink without falling into the water or hitting the side of the gameboard. On top of all of this, you only have 60 seconds to reach a cheese or your character will die and your timer will reset immediately. Once you reach a cheese, you'll be teleported back to the beginning and your quest for the next cheese will begin. The goal is to get all five cheeses in a round.

Winning the Game:
Techically, theres no real way to win the game. Sorry!
However, the goal is to get the highest score that you can. Each step towards a cheese will update a player's highest movement value and award them with 10 points towards their score. When a player gets a cheese, they get whatever time is left * 8 added to their score. (I made it times 8 because it made the score seem about right)

Enjoy!
This game took a long time to make (as I've never made a game with movement before) so I hope you enjoy the fruits of my labor! I will most likely make additions to this game over time, so please check back in the future! Go out and get the highest scores you can!
